# Ebay-item-webscrapper
Finds the average price of a product and displays it on a website if it meets a certain price

## Motivation
I re sell sneakers on the side as a hobby/side-hustle and wanted to find a way where I can check the average price of an item and be notified if it reached a minimum price that I 
can sell for profit. This helps me in the future if i ever start re selling alot of sneakers I would have to search and compare the price of each one which will eventually become
tedious.

## Description
The Python script was implemented by using the libraries BeautifulSoup and Request to go to the website and get the Html and parse the prices in order to calculate 
the averages. I took the results and made a web app using Flask for the back end and Html, Css for the Front end. The reason i made it into a webapp was so this was easily 
accessible to me incase i dont have the script with me.
